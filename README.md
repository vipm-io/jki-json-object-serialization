## How to Contribute

Take a look at the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/vipm-io/jki-json-object-serialization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues list. If it's your first contribution or you're not extremely familiar with this library, you might want to look at the [Good First Issues](https://github.com/vipm-io/jki-json-object-serialization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood+first+issue) list.  If you see an issue that looks like one you can complete, add a comment to the issue stating you'd like to work on it, and a maintainer will follow up and "assigned" to you. You then create a branch and then submit your contribution in the form of a [Pull Requests](https://github.com/vipm-io/jki-json-object-serialization/pulls).

Also, please see the [OpenG Developer Guide](https://github.com/vipm-io/OpenG-Toolkit/blob/main/docs/developer-guide.md) for information on how to obtain and start contributing to the code.
